Resilient Coders JavaScript 101 & 201 Workshop
================================================

Day 1: JavaScript 101
---------------------------

We will be working with just code & a console on JSBin.com.

<a href="https://jsbin.com/?js,console">Open JSBin here</a>. Ensure the "JavaScript" & "Console" tabs are displayed.

After editing your JavaScript, you can re-run it with the keyboard shortcut "Ctrl" + "Enter".

If you fall behind, there is reference code (aka "the answers") in the 101. No looking ahead! And you should try to solve the problems on your own first.

Day 2: JavaScript 201
